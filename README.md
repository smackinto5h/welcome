# welcome


Hello  Everybody,

My name is Smackintosh. I'm new around here and just finding my way around. I enjoy to learn
new things so I figure if I want to learn how to code then I'd better spend time looking at code.
Here I am! lol. I'm currently in school learning a few things but nothing majorly cool. I get to 
learn the cool stuff on the internet like we used to when we were younger! lol. Eventually i'll
make a repository with actually programming stuff but for now this will do. It satisfies a
requirement for getting a GitHub education account. As soon as my school ID gets here i'm going 
to apply. lol. What can I say I like free stuff. Okay you guys have a great day/night. Depends when
you're reading this I guess doesn't it? See ya later.
